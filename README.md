# sqlquest

Ever wanted to go on an adventure but ended up taking an arrow to the knee?
No worries, sqlquest has your back!

## Purpose

sqlquest is meant to be a brutally simple SQL job DSL/runner. It's written in
coffeescript and is designed to be easy enough to use that non-programmers
can make use of it with little training.

## Usage

The idea behind sqlquest is that you'll fork the repository and start adding
your own quests. Upgrading just requires merging back upstream. Just make
sure that you don't make changes to sqlquest core downstream that you don't
intend to contribute back to upstream â€“ you may end up with nasty merge
conflicts in the future.

Quests (jobs) are just directories in `src/quests/` that contains coffeescript
files and possibly `sql/` directory. Take a look at `src/quests/test` for a
very trivial example.

Each quest should at a minimum have a file called `<questname>.coffee`. This
module should export one class that extends `Quest` from `../quest`. Quests
need to implement one method: `adventure`

Here is a very basic quest:

```coffeescript
Quest = require '../quest'

module.exports =
class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
  adventure: ->
    @sql 'CREATE TABLE myawesometable AS (SELECT * FROM somelessertable);'
    result = @sql 'SELECT count(*) from myawesometable;'
    console.log result.rows[0].count
```

You can also put sql in files. Let's assume you put the create table into a
sql file called `foo.sql` at `src/quests/awesome/sql`:

```coffeescript
Quest = require '../quest'

module.exports =
  class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
    adventure: ->
      @sql file: 'foo.sql'
      result = @sql 'SELECT count(*) from myawesometable;'
      console.log result.rows[0].count
```

Easy enough, right? Note that the result of each `sql` call is the result
of the last query in the sql.

## TODO

* Default implementation of `adventure` that just runs any sql file in `sql`
