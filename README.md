# sqlquest

Ever wanted to go on an adventure but ended up taking an arrow to the knee?
No worries, sqlquest has your back!

## Purpose

sqlquest is meant to be a brutally simple SQL job DSL/runner. It's written in
coffeescript and is designed to be easy enough to use that non-programmers
can make use of it with little training, and engineers can use it for complex
tasks. You can have your coffee and drink it too.

## Usage

sqlquest is meant to be used from an install in another project. The idea is
that you'll create your own 'myawesomequests' package. Example:

```
$ mkdir myawesomequests
$ cd myawesomequests
$ npm init
... follow instructions
$ npm install --save sqlquest
$ ln -s node_modules/.bin/sqlquest sqlquest
```

With this symlink, you can run sqlquest from the top level of your project.

Create a directory called `quests/`. This is where you'll put all your quests.
Each quest is a directory (the name of the quest) with at a minimum either a
`.{coffee,js}` file or a `.sql` file at the top level.

You can run quests like so:

```
$ ./sqlquest awesomequest
```

This will run the quest in `quests/awesomequest/`.

## Quests

So how do you go on these damned quests? Well, we have a DSL for that!

Create a file, `quests/awesomequest/sql/awesome.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE numbers (
  n integer
);

INSERT INTO TABLE numbers VALUES
  (1),
  (2),
  (3),
  (4);

SELECT * FROM numbers
WHERE a_number > {{min}};
```

Now create a file called `quests/awesomequest/awesome.coffee`

```coffee
Quest = require 'sqlquest'

module.exports =
class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
  adventure: ->
    @sql file: 'awesome.sql', {min: @opts.min}
```

Now you can run your **awesome** quest like so:

```
$ ./sqlquest awesomequest -u myuser -H my.db.com -d mydb -- --min 2
```

or

```
$ ./sqlquest awesomequest --url postgres://myuser:mypass@my.db.com/mydb -- --min 2
```

You should now see sqlquest running each block of sql in your `awesome.sql` file
one by one, outputting the queries and their execution times. Since we passed an
object as the second arg to `@sql` the sql is assumed to contain mustache
syntax like `{{variable}}` which will be filled in with the object's data.

If ya really really wanted, you could just embed the sql in the file itself:

```coffee
Quest = require 'sqlquest'

module.exports =
  class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
    adventure: ->
      @sql """CREATE TABLE numbers (
                n integer
              );

              INSERT INTO TABLE numbers VALUES
                (1),
                (2),
                (3),
                (4);

              SELECT * FROM numbers
              WHERE a_number > {{min}};""",
        min: @opts.min
```

Pretty dope, right?

There are other helpers to make your adventure easier.

## Inventory

sqlquest has a number of baked in potions to keep you healthy. Take a gander.
To dig a bit deeper, sift through the code. Bit of prose in there.

### transactions

You can do transactions the normal way, just by shoving `BEGIN` and such in
place, but there's also a helper for that:

```coffee
Quest = require 'sqlquest'

module.exports =
  class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
    adventure: ->
      @transaction =>
        @sql file: 'foo.sql'
        @sql file: 'bar.sql'
```

This simply takes the function passed to it and executes it after running
`BEGIN;`. If an uncaught error occurs, it will catch and run `ROLLBACK;` before
throwing the error back up. So, that's a little cooler than doing it yourself,
right?

### retries

Transactions are neat, but what if you want to perhaps retry in the event of an
error? Well, we've got a spell for that as well:

```coffee
Quest = require 'sqlquest'

module.exports =
  class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
    adventure: ->
      @retry =>
        @sql file: 'foo.sql'
        @sql file: 'bar.sql'
```

Does what it says on the tin. When just passed a function, it defaults the
number of retries allowed to 10 and the wait between retries to 5000
milliseconds. You can change that.

```coffee
@retry times: 5, wait: 2000 =>
  ...
```

Oh, and you can give it an array of regular expressions to only retry on
certain matching error messages.


```coffee
@retry times: 5, wait: 2000, okErrors: [/omg error/], =>
  ...
```

If you'd like to continue execution of your quest in the event of a failure to
retry after exhausting tries, pass `silent: true`. This will cause no error
to be thrown regardless of what happens in the retry loop, but will make sure
the exit code is set to 1 when the quest exits to report failure.

### little bobby tables

You probably want to see the results of queries sometimes. It's not trivial to
output them in a readable way.





Nah, I'm just kidding, we got something for that too:

```coffee
@table @sql(file: 'foo.sql')
```

That'll output the results as a table. Just like dat.

### All together now!

```coffee
Quest = require 'sqlquest'

module.exports =
  class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
    adventure: ->
      @retry times: 5, wait: 2000, okErrors: [/my silly error/], =>
        @transaction =>
          @sql file: 'foo.sql', {foo: 1, bar: 2}
          @table @sql(file: 'bar.sql')
```

## Options

You have access to options passed to sqlquest after `--`. These are your quest
options. The options will be parsed as best as possible automatically, but you
can also specify your option spec to be given to [nomnom](https://github.com/harthur/nomnom)
before parsing:

```coffee
class MyQuest extends Quest
  options:
    name:
      abbr: 'n'
      required: true
...
```

In any case, parsed options can be found in `@opts`.

## Simple Parameterized SQL

Don't need an adventure? Well, use a cheat code. If your quest does not have a
`<quest>.{coffee,js}` file, then no biggie, just drop a sql file in your quest
directory. It'll find the first sql file and it'll just run it. If the file has
mustaches it'll fill 'em in with options passed after `--`.

## Safe Parameterized Queries

If for some reason mustache isn't working out for you and you want to use
node-postgres's safe parameterized queries (which protect against sql injection
attacks), you can use those too. Just use the object-as-first-arg form of `@sql`
and pass it a `params` property:

```coffee
@sql text: "INSERT INTO foo VALUES ($1);", params: [1]
```

The above will replace $1 with the number 1.

*Note that unlike with mustache replacements, the outputted query will be not
have its variables filled in. I've yet to find a way to get the substituted
final query out of node-postgres.*

## Splitting Queries

When you use sqlquest, you'll notice that it is somehow splitting even large
sql files into chunks and timing each individual query. This is because sqlquest
has support for hitting an API to split SQL into its individual queries.

Why do we use an external service? Well, because there aren't any good node libs
for parsing and dealing with sql code, and there was a better library written in
Python with a already running API behind it. I'd rather not have to make this
project depend on Python directly, so this seemed like a nice compromise.

The service used by default is [sqlformat.org](http://sqlformat.org), but this
is entirely configurable. sqlformat has an IP-based API limit of 500 requests
per hour. I cannot vouch for the security of this API. I encourage you to
deploy our [open source flask server](https://github.com/scopely/sqlsplit) that
does the same thing!

### Server Spec

Just implement an endpoint that takes a POST with a `sql` form parameter
containing a string of sql. It should return, in json:

```json
{
  "result": [query1, query2, ...]
}
```

### Turning It Off

You can make `@sql` not split by using the first-arg-is-options format and
passing `split: false`:

```coffee
@sql text: "SELECT * FROM bar;SELECT * FROM foo;",
     split: false
```

### Supported SQL DBs

* Postgres
* Redshift (written for usage here)

## Config

You can specify any of sqlquest's options in a `config.toml` file, or pass
`--config` to where the config is.

```toml
host = "foo.db.com"
user = "me"
...
```

## Plugins

SQLQuest has a simple built in plugin system that can be used to add
fucntionality. First of all, here's how you use a plugin:

```coffee
module.exports =
class MyQuest extends Quest
  plugins: [
    'sqlquest-reporting'
  ]
  ...
```

That's it. The string `'sqlquest-reporting'` is the same thing you'd pass to
`require` to require the plugin module and it is, in fact, what happens under
the hood.

So how does that work? Well, take a look at
[sqlquest-reporting](https://github.com/scopely/sqlquest-reporting). A plugin
is a module that exports one single function that takes the current `Quest`
object and... does stuff with it.

`Quest` has a built in `addHelper` method that plugins can call on the quest
to add their own helper functions. For example, the reporting plugin adds
`@report`!

Finally, `Quest` is an `EventEmitter`. As such, you can capture `Quest`'s
internal events and also add your own in your plugins. Poke around the `Quest`
class to see which events you can track!

### Namespacing

If your helpers aren't going to be fairly uniquely named in some way, it's
recommended that you namespace your helpers. Basically, instead of adding
commonly named helper methods, add one uniquely (like your project name,
possibly) named helper that points to a class or a hash â€“ something that you
allows for the dot accessor syntax. Folks can then access your plugin via that
helper, and you can name your helpers whatever you like:

```coffee
@myplugin.lol stuff
```

That said, some of Scopely's own plugins might break this rule a bit. C'mon,
we made the darn thing, we should be allowed to stomp all over the namespace,
right?!

## Organizing Your Quests

The trick here is mostly to remember that you don't need to just have one single
`quests` directory. You can specify the quests direction via the `-q` option.
You can organize your quests pretty much however you see fit!
