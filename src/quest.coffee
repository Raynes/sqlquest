# Public: Base quest class.
#
# {Quest} is the important part of the equation. Its methods make up the DSL
# that makes sqlquest special and powerful. Extend this class and implement the
# {{Quest::adventure}} method to create a quest. # When a subclass of {Quest} is
# instantiated, it runs its {{Quest::adventure}} method inside of a fiber with
# [node-sync](https://github.com/ybogdanov/node-sync). The provided methods are
# synchronous by default, and this is a core part of what makes the {Quest} DSL
# powerful. {{Quest::sql}} can take a callback, but by default it executes
# queries synchronous so that you can author your SQL quests (jobs) in a clean,
# easy, readable way.
#
# ## Examples
#
# The simplest example is a completely blank implementation
#
# ```coffee
# class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
# ```
#
# This will cause sqlquest to simply look for a `quests/awesome/sql/awesome.sql`
# file and run it with {{Quest::sql}}. This covers the most trivial usecases.
# For more advanced usage where you want to embed sql, deal with results of
# queries, run multiple files, do retries, etc, you'll want to implement
# {{Quest::adventure}}.
#
# ```coffee
# class AwesomeQuest extends Quest
#   adventure: ->
#     @sql """SELECT * FROM foo
#             WHERE athing > anotherthing"""
#     @sql file: "lol.sql"
#     @sql "SELECT * from {{table}}", table: 'atablename'
# ```
#
# See {{Quest::sql}} for a detailed description of what is possible.

  # presumably executes some sql and stuff), then runs `COMMIT` unless an
  # uncaught exception occurs.
  #

  # ## Examples
